# Architecture — Phase 2 Redesign (Core Framework MVP)

This document explains the architecture being built in Phase 3, and why,
following the findings in `docs/architecture-review.md`. Scope for this
pass is the **Core Framework MVP**: a real planning → geometry → validation
→ execution pipeline with a fully working, testable headless backend, and a
correctly-refactored AutoCAD COM backend that cannot be exercised in this
Linux sandbox (verification on Windows is the user's responsibility). It
deliberately does not yet include the dashboard, REST API, plugin
marketplace, multi-format import (PDF/image/sketch), or the standards
knowledge base — those are later phases layered on top of this spine.

## Design goals driving every decision below

1. **Testable without Windows or a CAD license.** The single biggest reason
   the original repo has zero tests is that its only backend requires a
   live, GUI-attached AutoCAD COM object. Everything that can be backend-
   agnostic (planning, geometry, validation) must not import `win32com`,
   and there must be at least one backend (`dxf`) that runs anywhere.
2. **One source of truth per concern.** The review's top complaint was
   ~600 duplicated lines across `process_command` and `handle_call_tool`,
   plus config loaded independently in three files. Every tool is defined
   once (name, JSON schema, handler) and both the direct-tool-call path and
   the natural-language path route through the same planner → validator →
   backend pipeline.
3. **Plan before you draw.** The old code executed one COM call per tool
   invocation with no intermediate artifact. The new pipeline always
   produces a serializable `DrawingPlan` (typed, Pydantic-validated) before
   anything touches a backend, which is what makes validation, dry-run, and
   future undo/redo possible at all.
4. **Backend is an interchangeable adapter, not a fork in every function.**
   `CADBackend` is an abstract interface; `DXFBackend` and `AutoCADBackend`
   are two implementations of it. Adding ZWCAD/GstarCAD-specific quirks or
   a future FreeCAD backend means writing a new adapter class, not editing
   `cad_controller.py`'s `if/elif` chain in two places.

## Module map

```
engine/
  geometry/
    primitives.py   — Pydantic entity models (Line, Circle, Arc, Ellipse,
                       Polyline, Rectangle, Text, Hatch, Dimension) + DrawingPlan.
                       This is the shared vocabulary every other module speaks.
    engine.py        — GeometryEngine: derived geometry (rectangle -> corner
                       points, bounding boxes) used by validation and backends.
  planner/
    intent.py        — IntentDetector protocol + the concrete detector backed
                       by nlp.fallback today; swappable for an LLM-backed
                       detector later without touching the planner.
    planner.py        — Planner: text -> Intent -> typed DrawingPlan, and a
                       direct path (already-typed tool args -> DrawingPlan)
                       used by explicit MCP tool calls.
  validator/
    rules.py          — individual rule functions (invalid geometry, invalid
                       lineweight, duplicate entities, missing text, layer
                       naming) each returning a list of Issues.
    engine.py         — ValidationEngine: runs all rules, produces a
                       ValidationReport, and autofix() for safe corrections.
cad/
  backend.py           — CADBackend ABC (start/is_running/execute/save/
                        create_layer) + ExecutionResult, shared by every backend.
  registry.py           — name -> backend class registry/factory driven by config.
dxf/
  backend.py             — DXFBackend(CADBackend): real, headless, ezdxf-based.
                          The only backend exercised by the test suite.
autocad/
  backend.py              — AutoCADBackend(CADBackend): refactored COM driver
                          for AutoCAD/GstarCAD/ZWCAD. Fixes the `old_app`
                          NameError, the duplicated app-id lookup, per-entity
                          Regen, unbounded layer scans, and unsanitized save
                          paths identified in the review. Windows-only;
                          import guarded so the rest of the platform still
                          runs on Linux/macOS/CI.
nlp/
  fallback.py              — Refactored regex/keyword parser (the old
                          nlp_processor.py), demoted to what it actually is:
                          a cheap, offline fallback intent source, not "the
                          NLP layer." Bugs fixed, single keyword table.
apps/server/
  tools.py                  — ToolSpec registry: one definition per tool
                          (name, Pydantic args model, handler). Single
                          source for MCP `list_tools` schemas *and*
                          `call_tool` dispatch *and* `process_command`.
  server.py                  — MCP stdio server wiring: config -> backend
                          registry -> planner/validator -> tool registry.
config.py                    — One Pydantic settings model, env-overridable
                          (`CADMCP_*`), replacing the three independent
                          `config.json` readers in the original code.
tests/                        — pytest suite; everything except a possible
                          future `test_autocad_backend.py` runs on Linux.
```

## Pipeline (matches the master vision, scoped to what exists today)

```
MCP tool call  ──┐                      Natural language ("process_command")
(typed args)     │                                │
                 ▼                                ▼
        Planner.plan_from_operation      Planner.plan_from_text
                 │                                │  (IntentDetector: nlp.fallback)
                 └───────────────┬────────────────┘
                                  ▼
                            DrawingPlan (Pydantic, serializable)
                                  ▼
                     GeometryEngine (derived geometry, bounding boxes)
                                  ▼
                    ValidationEngine.validate() → autofix() if safe
                                  ▼
                         CADBackend.execute(plan)
                        (DXFBackend or AutoCADBackend,
                         selected by config.cad.backend)
                                  ▼
                          ExecutionResult (per-entity handles/errors)
```

Every tool call — whether it came from a typed MCP tool invocation or a
free-text `process_command` string — flows through the *same* plan/validate/
execute pipeline. That is what eliminates the duplicated dispatch logic and
is the prerequisite for adding an LLM-backed planner later without another
rewrite.

## What is explicitly deferred (not stubbed)

Per the "core framework MVP" scope, the following from the master vision are
**not** built in this pass, and no placeholder directories were created for
them (an empty `dashboard/` or `plugins/` folder communicates nothing and
just adds noise):

- REST API / dashboard / plugin SDK
- Multi-format import (PDF, image, hand sketch, Excel/CSV, flowcharts)
- Symbol libraries / ANSI-ISO-IEC standards knowledge base
- DWG/SVG/PDF/LISP/SCR export (DXF is the one working export format for now)
- FreeCAD/Fusion/SolidWorks/Revit backends (the `CADBackend` interface is
  designed so these can be added later as new adapters)

These become straightforward additions once the planning/validation/backend
spine exists and is under test — building them now, before that spine is
proven, would mean rewriting them anyway.
